# PySAC
A python based ML algorithm for the gibbs free enegy of various intermediates on single atom catalysts
************************************************************
Developed by Mohsen Tamtaji (mtamtaji@connect.ust.hk) Under supervision of Professor Tom Luo at HKUST

ML algorithm for the prediction of Gibbss free energy of N2*, H*, OH*, O*, OOH*, COOH*, CO*, and CHO* intermediates for NRR, HER, ORR, and CO2RR

SVR model is trained based on 2104 data in the literature for graphene-based single atom catalysts
